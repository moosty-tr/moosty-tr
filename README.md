- 👋 Hi, I’m @moosty-tr
- 👀 I’m interested in simple IoT devices that can be programmed by Arduino IDE 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP for building microservices for IoT devices. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project which is intended for senior people health monitoring:
  - 💞️ Based on sensor data
  - 💞️ Protecting privacy: No need to monitor people by camera
  - 💞️ Sense by sensors and ESP hardware, forward it to a PHP microservice to record in a MySql database
  - 💞️ Be cheap as much as possible, both for hardware and microservice hosting.
  - 💞️ Be open source
  - 💞️ Be first step for AI application. Learn peoples "usual" by time and alarm when something happens "unusual"
